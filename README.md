# Hurricane Project

In order to properly install the `gganimate` package:

1. Install gganimate by running the following line of code in R: devtools::install_github("dgrtwo/gganimate")
   This requires that the `devtools` package has already been installed in R.
2. Outside of R, install the `ImageMagick` and `Animation` onto your machine.
3. For Mac users, the program Homebrew must be installed on your machine using terminal
4. Once Homebrew in installed, run the following line of code in terminal: brew install imagemagick

At this point, the `gganimate` package should be installed on your machine and running properly.
