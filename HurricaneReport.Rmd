# Results

> What does model tell you about the research question?
> Interpret coefficients in context/explain relevance

# Diagnostics

> Full diagnostics of the model
> Predictions

# Conclusion

> First - remind of question and provide summary of findings
> Second - Discussion of model limitations
  > What can be done to improve the model?
  > What can be done to improve the data?
